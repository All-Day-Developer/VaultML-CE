# VaultML Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is made between **All-Day Developer** (“we”, “our”, or “VaultML”) and **you** (“Contributor”).

By submitting a Contribution to the VaultML CE project, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. Copyright Assignment

- You hereby assign and transfer to **All-Day Developer** all right, title, and interest in the copyright of your Contributions.  
- This means that **All-Day Developer becomes the sole legal copyright owner** of all Contributions you submit.  
- You retain the right to use, copy, and distribute your own Contributions for any purpose, but you may not revoke the rights granted to All-Day Developer.

---

## 2. Definitions

- **Contribution** means any source code, object code, documentation, patch, design, or other work submitted to VaultML CE.  
- **Project** means VaultML CE and related repositories maintained by All-Day Developer.

---

## 3. License Back to Contributor

Although ownership is transferred, All-Day Developer grants you a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, and distribute your Contributions as you wish.  
This ensures you can always use your work independently.

---

## 4. Patent License

You grant to All-Day Developer and its licensees a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license** under any patents you control that would otherwise be infringed by your Contributions.  
This license allows VaultML CE and VaultML EE to freely use your Contributions without patent risk.

---

## 5. Representations

You represent that:
- Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to assign copyright and grant licenses.  
- Your Contribution does not knowingly infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.  
- You are legally entitled to submit the Contribution and enter into this Agreement.

---

## 6. Dual Licensing

You acknowledge and agree that:
- VaultML CE is distributed under the **GNU AGPL v3 (or later)**.  
- VaultML EE may include Contributions from VaultML CE, but is distributed under a **separate commercial license**.  
- Because All-Day Developer is the sole copyright owner, it may license Contributions under both AGPL (community) and proprietary terms (enterprise).

---

## 7. No Obligation

This Agreement does not obligate All-Day Developer to include your Contributions in any product.  
Acceptance of Contributions is at All-Day Developer’s sole discretion.

---

## 8. Entire Agreement

This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and All-Day Developer regarding Contributions.  
It supersedes all prior agreements or understandings.
